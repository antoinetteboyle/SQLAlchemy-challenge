# SQLAlchemy-challenge
Surfs Up!  Climate analysis!

I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with the trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on the area. 

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database including SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

This climate analysis can be found at [starter notebook](/main/climate_starter.ipynb). This includes the precipiation analysis and the station analysis.

I designed a Flask API based on the queries that were just developed. [app/py](/main/app.py)

The following are optional challenge queries:
